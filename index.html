                        There were many origin stories of how the universe first formed. This origin story is from the Greeks. 
                        First, there was only evil, chaos and nothingness. There was darkness, night, earth and other stuff like that. 
                        Darkness and night made day and light, and earth made everything on earth, like mountains, water and sky. 
                        Then earth mated with sky and produced 12 titans, cyclops, and hecatoncheires, and due to an argument between earth 
                        and sky, a titan made sky throw his genitals in the ocean and then the titan mated with Rhea and produced the gods. 
                        And then a war broke out between the gods and titans, gods won and ruled the world from Mount Olympus. 
                        The scientific origin story is in the next section.

                        First the universe started off really small with only gas, and gradually space expanded into itself, 
                        and we started off as tiny little super hot particles. Eventually those particles expanded into different 
                        elementary particles, and then a fight broke out between matter and antimatter, but matter kept winning so that
                        generated more protons and neutrons. After that, hydrogen started to form, which formed galaxies and stars, and much 
                        later, humans started to become humans.

                        The concept of gravity is very important in the universe.
                        If it werenâ€™t there, there would be no me, no you, no stars or anything at all. 
                        The gravity is probably the first reason our solar system formed, it caused imbalances and imperfections in the universe, 
                        which is what caused the universe to form. The universe was first just gas and there was a small irregularity / imbalance.
                        Then over the time period of over 200 million years, gravity began to pull the gas together to produce the first 
                        structures that will form everything we have today. Also, the reason that our solar system isn't just destroyed 
                        completely is because if two objects are too close the larger one will pull in and destroy the small one and if they 
                        are too far they will just float off so each of the planets has to be the perfect distance from the sun and it has to 
                        have the perfect gravitational force and speed.
